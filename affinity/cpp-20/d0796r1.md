# Abstract

This paper provides an initial meta-framework for the drives toward memory affinity for C++.  It accounts for feedback from the Toronto 2017 SG1 meeting that we should define affinity for C++ first, before considering inaccessible memory as a solution to the separate memory problem towards supporting heterogeneous and distributed computing.

# Motivation

**Affinity** refers to the "closeness" in terms of memory access performance, between running code, the hardware execution resource on which the code runs, and the data that the code accesses.  A hardware execution resource has "more affinity" to a part of memory or to some data, if it has lower latency and/or higher bandwidth when accessing that memory / those data.

On almost all computer architectures, the cost of accessing different data may differ. Most computers have caches that are associated with specific processing units. If the operating system moves a thread or process from one processing unit to another, the thread or process will no longer have data in its new cache that it had in its old cache. This may make the next access to those data slower. Many computers also have a Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA), which means that even though all processing units see a single memory in terms of programming model, different processing units may still have more affinity to some parts of memory than others. NUMA architectures exist because it is difficult to scale non-NUMA memory systems to the performance needed by today's highly parallel computers and applications.

One strategy to improve applications' performance, given the importance of affinity, is processor and memory **binding**. Keeping a process bound to a specific thread and local memory region optimizes cache affinity. It also reduces context switching and unnecessary scheduler activity. Since memory accesses to remote locations incur higher latency and/or lower bandwidth, control of thread placement to enforce affinity within parallel applications is crucial to fuel all the cores and to exploit the full performance of the memory subsystem on Non-Uniform Memory Architectures (NUMA). 

Operating systems (OSes) traditionally take responsibility for assigning threads or processes to run on processing units. However, OSes may use high-level policies for this assignment that do not necessarily match the optimal usage pattern for a given application. Application developers must leverage the placement of memory and **placement of threads** for best performance on current and future architectures. For C++ developers to achieve this, native support for **placement of threads and memory** is critical for application portability. We will refer to this as the **affinity problem**. 

The affinity problem is especially challenging for applications whose behavior changes over time or is hard to predict, or when different applications interfere with each other's performance. Today, most OSes already can group processing units according to their locality and distribute processes, while keeping threads close to the initial thread, or even avoid migrating threads and maintain first touch policy. Nevertheless, most programs can change their work distribution, especially in the presence of nested parallelism.

Frequently, data is initialized at the beginning of the program by the initial thread and is used by multiple threads. While automatic thread migration has been implemented in some OSes, migration may have high overhead. In an optimal case, the OS may automatically detect which thread access which data most frequently, or it may replicate data which is read by multiple threads, or migrate data which is modified and used by threads residing on remote locality groups. However, the OS often does a reasonable job, if the machine is not overloaded, if the application carefully used first-touch allocation, and if the program does not change its behavior with respect to locality.

Consider a code example (Listing 1) that uses the C++17 parallel STL algorithm `for_each` to modify the entries of a `valarray` `a`.  The example applies a loop body in a lambda to each entry of the `valarray` `a`, using a parallel execution policy that distributes work in parallel across multiple CPU cores. We might expect this to be fast, but since `valarray` containers are initialized automatically and automatically allocated on the master thread's memory, we find that it is actually quite slow even when we have more than one thread. 

```cpp
// C++ valarray STL containers are initialized automatically.
// First-touch allocation thus places all of a on the master.
std::valarray<double> a(N);

// Data placement is wrong, so parallel update is slow.
std::for_each(par, std::begin(a), std::end(a),
  [=] (double& a_i) { scalar * a_i; });

// Use future affinity interface to migrate data at next
// use and move pages closer to next accessing thread.
...
// Faster, because data are local now.
std::for_each(par, std::begin(a), std::end(a),
  [=] (double& a) { scalar * a_i; } );
```
*Listing 1: Parallel vector update example*

The affinity interface we propose should help computers achieve a much higher fraction of peak memory bandwidth when using parallel algorithms. In the future, we plan to extend this to heterogeneous and distributed computing. This follows the lead of OpenMP [14], which has plans to integrate its affinity model with its heterogeneous model [21]. (One of the authors of this document participated in the design of OpenMP's affinity model.)

# Background Research: State of the Art

The problem of effectively partitioning a system’s topology is one which has been so for some time, and there are a range of third party libraries / standards which provides APIs to solve the problem. In order to standardise this process for C++ we must carefully look at all of these approaches and identify which we wish to adopt. Below is a list of the libraries and standards which this proposal will draw from:

* [Portable Hardware Locality][hwloc]
* [SYCL 1.2][sycl-1-2-1]
* [OpenCL 2.2][opencl-2-2]
* [HSA][HSA]
* [OpenMP 5.0][openmp-5]
* [cpuaff][cpuaff]
* [Persistent Memory Programming][pmem]
* [MEMKIND][memkid]
* [Solaris pbind()][solaris-pbind]
* [Linux sched_setaffinity()][linux-sched-setaffinity]
* [Windows SetThreadAffinityMask()][windows-set-thread-affinity-mask]
* [Chapel][chapel]
* [X10][x10]
* [UPC++][upc++]
* [TBB][tbb]
* [HPX][hpx]
* [MADNESS][madness]

Libraries such as the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) [9] provide a low level of hardware abstraction and offer a solution for the portability problem by supporting many platforms and operating systems. This and similar approaches may provide detailed hardware information in a tree-like structure. However, even some current systems cannot be represented correctly by a tree, where the number of hops between two sockets vary between socket pairs [14].

Some systems will provide additional user control through explicit binding of threads to processors through environment variables consumed by various compilers, system commands (e.g. Linux: taskset, numactl; Windows: start /affinity), or system calls for example Solaris has `pbind()`, Linux has `sched_setaffinity()` and Windows has `SetThreadAffinityMask()`.

## Problem Space

In this paper we describe the problem space of affinity for C++, the various challenges which need to be addressed in defining a partitioning and affinity interface for C++ and some suggested solutions:

* How to represent, identify and navigate the topology of execution resources available within a heterogeneous or distributed system.
* How to query and measure the relative affininty between different execution resources within a system.
* How to bind execution and allocation particular execution resource(s).
* What kind of and level of interface(s) should be provided by C++ for affinity.

Wherever possible, we also evaluate how an affinity based solution could be scaled to support both distributed and heterogeneous systems.

There are some additional challenges which we have been investigating but are not yet ready to be included in this paper and will be presented in a future paper:

* Migrating data from memory allocated in one partition to another
* Defining memory placement algorithms or policies

## Querying a System’s Topology

The first task in allowing C++ applications to leverage memory locality is to provide the ability to query a **system** for its **resource topology** (commonly represented as a tree or graph) and traverse its **execution resources**.

## Execution resource

The capability of querying underlying **execution resources** of a given **system** is particularly important towards supporting affinity control in C++. The current proposal for executors [5] leaves the **execution resource** largely unspecified. This is intentional: **execution resources** will vary greatly between one implementation and another, and it is out of the scope of the current executors proposal to define those.

There is current work on extending the executors proposal to describe a typical interface for an **execution context** [8]. In this paper a typical **execution context** is defined with an interface for construction and comparison, and for retrieving an **executor**, waiting on submitted work to complete and querying the underlying **execution resource**.

Extending the executors interface to provide topology information can serve as a basis for providing a unified interface to expose affinity. This interface cannot mandate a specific architectural definition, and must be generic enough that future architectural evolutions can still be expressed.

## Level of abstraction

An important consideration when defining a unified interface for querying the **resource topology** of a **system** is what level of abstraction should such an interface have and at what granularity the **execution resources** of the topology be described.

As both the level of abstraction of an **execution resource** and the granularity that it is described in will vary greatly from one implementation to another, it’s important for the interface to be generic enough to support any level of abstraction. To achieve this we propose a generic hierarchical structure of **execution resources**; each **execution resource** being composed of other **execution resources** recursively. Each **execution resource** within this hierarchy can be used to place memory (i.e allocate memory within the **execution resource’s** memory region) or place execution (i.e. bind an execution to an **execution resource’s execution agents**) or both.

> For example a NUMA system will likely have a hierarchy of nodes, each capable of placing memory and placing agents and a CPU + GPU system may have GPU local memory regions capable of placing memory but not capable of placing agents.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface for querying a system’s resource topology be completely abstract or should it provide specific components of the hardware architecture? |

## Representation

Nowadays, there are various APIs and libraries that enable this functionality. One of the most commonly used is the Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) [9]. Hwloc presents the hardware as a tree, where the root node represents the whole machine and subsequent levels represents different partitions depending on different hardware characteristics. The picture below shows the output of the hwloc visualization tool (lstopo) on a 2-socket Xeon E5300 server. Note that each socket is represented by a package in the graph. Each socket contain its own cache memories, but both share the same NUMA memory region. Note also that different I/O units are visible underneath: Placement of these units w.r.t to memory and threads can be critical to performance. The ability of placing threads and/or allocating memory appropriately on the different components of this system is an important part of the process of application development, especially as hardware architectures get more complex. The documentation of lstopo [22] shows more interesting examples of topologies that can be encountered on today systems.

![alt text](hwloc-topology.png "Hwloc topology"){:width="100%"}

However, systems are becoming increasingly non-hierarchical and a traditional tree based representation of a **system’s resource topology** may not suffice anymore [18]. The HSA standard solve this problem by allowing a node in the topology to have multiple parent nodes [19]. This proposal in this paper currently focuses on a tree based solution for representing the **system’s resource topology** however we wish to investigate other alternatives in a future paper.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface for querying a system’s resource topology support non-hierarchical architectures. |
| *What kind of shape do we want for expressing the topology abstraction?* |

## Extended Execution Resource Interface

Below is a proposed interface for the generalization of the **execution resource** based on the definition of `thread_execution_resource_t` [8] with some extensions.

```cpp
struct execution_resource {

  execution_resource() = delete;
  execution_resource(const execution_resource &) = delete;  
  execution_resource(execution_resource &&) = delete;
  execution_resource &operator=(const execution_resource &) = delete;
  execution_resource &operator=(execution_resource &&) = delete;

  size_t concurrency() const noexcept;
  size_t partition_size() const noexcept;

  const execution_resource &partition(size_t i) const noexcept;
  const execution_resource &member_of() const noexcept;

  std::string name() const noexcept;

  bool can_place_memory() const noexcept;
  bool can_place_agent() const noexcept;

};
```
*Listing 3: Proposed extended execution resource interface*

The interface described above describes an execution resource as an object which cannot be user constructed, copied or moved, only referenced. It provides an interface for recursively querying the partitions and concurrency of it’s child execution resources via the member functions `concurrency`, `partition_size` and `partition` and it’s parent execution resource via the member function `member_of`. This interface is designed to match the design of `thread_execution_resource_t` [8]. Note that the resource is not limited to be an **execution resource**, but also a general resource where no execution can take place but memory can be allocated such as off-chip memory.

> The intention is that the actual implementation details of a resource topology are described in an execution context when required. This allows the execution resource objects to be lightweight objects that serve as identifiers that are only referenced.

The interface also provides a member functions for querying whether the **resource** can place memory regions and place execution agents; `can_place_memory` and `can_place_agents`, for querying an user-friendly name of the resource; name.

We may also wish to mirror the design of the executors proposal and have a generic query interface using properties for querying information about a **resource**. It’s expected that an implementation may provide additional non standard queries that are specific to that implementation.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface allow an execution resource to place memory, place agents or both? |
| *Is what is defined here a suitable solution?* |

### Querying the topology

The interface for querying the **resource topology** of a **system** must be flexible enough to allow both querying all **execution resources** available under an **execution context** and querying the **execution resources** available to the entire system and constructing an execution context for a particular execution resource. This important as many standards such as OpenCL [20] and HSA [19] require the ability to query the **resource topology** available in a **system** before constructing an **execution context** for executing work.

> For example an implementation may provide an execution context for a particular execution resource such as a static thread pool or a GPU context for a particular GPU device or an implementation may provide a more generic execution context which can be constructed from a number of CPU and GPU devices queryable through the system resource topology.

Below is a proposed interface for querying a **system** for its **resource topology**.

```cpp
namespace std::this_system {
  execution_resource &resource();
}
```
*Listing 4: Interface for querying the execution resources available within a system*

The **resource** function in the `this_system` namespace will return the root **execution resource** of the current system.

Below is an example of the interface for querying the **execution resources** available to the entire system and printing out the names of each **execution resource**.

```cpp
auto &resource = std::execution::this_system::resource();

for (int i = 0 ; i < partition_size(); i++) {
    std::cout << resource.partition(i).name()  << std::endl;
}
```
*Listing 5: Example of querying the execution resources available within a system*

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface provide a way of querying the system topology directly? |
| *Is what is defined here a suitable solution?* |

Below is a proposed extension to the **execution context** interface to allow an **execution context** to be constructed from an **execution resource**.

```cpp
struct execution_context {
  ...

  template <typename ExecutionResource>
  execution_context(ExecutionResource &&execResource);

  ...
};
```
*Listing 6: Extension to execution_context interface*

The **execution context** constructor described above allows constructing an **execution context** from any **execution resource** within a **system’s resource topology**. The constructed **execution context** can then execute work on any resource under that **execution resource**.

Below is an example of how this extended interface could be used to construct an **execution context** from an **execution resource** which is retrieved from the **system’s resource topology**.

Once an execution context is constructed it can then still be queried for its execution resource and then that execution resource can be further partitioned.

```cpp
auto &resources = std::execution::this_system::resources();

std::execution::execution_context execContext(resources[0]);

auto &execResource = execContext.resource();

// resource[0] should be equal to execResource

for (int i = 0; i < resource.partition_size(); i++) {
    std::cout << resource.partition(i).name()  << std::endl;
}
```
*Listing 7: Example of constructing an execution context from an execution resource*

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface provide a way of creating an execution context from an execution resource? |
| *Is what is defined here a suitable solution?* |

### Topology Discovery & Fault Tolerance

In traditional single CPU systems the execution resources can be reasoned about using standard constructs such as `std::thread`, `std::this_thread` and `thread_local`. This is because the C++ machine model requires that a system have **at least one thread of execution, some memory and some I/O capabilities**. This means that for these systems some assumptions can be made about the system resource topology can be made as part of the language and supporting std library. For example the fact that developers can query always the hardware concurrency available as there is always at least one thread or the fact that you can always use thread local storage.

This assumption, however, does not hold on newer more complex systems, and is particularly false in heterogeneous systems. In these systems, even the availabiliy of high level resources available in a particular **system** (the type and number of resources) is not known until the physical hardware attached to a particular system has been identified by the program. This often happens as part of a runtime initialisation API [19] [20] which the resources available through som software abstraction. Furthermore the resources which are identified often have different levels of parallel and concurrenct execution capabilities. This process of identifying resources and their capabilities is often refered to as **topology discovery** and the point at the point at which this occurs as the **point of discovery**.

An interesting question which arises here is whether the **system resource topology** should be fixed at the **point of discovery** or be allowed to be dynamic and alter during the course of the program. We can identify two main reasons for allowing the **system resource topology** to be dynamic after the *point of discovery*: (A) **online resource discovery** and **fault tolerance**.

In some systems, hardware can be attached to the system while the program is executing, for example, a [USB-compute device][movidius] that can be plugged in while the application is running to add additional computational power, or a remote hardware connected over a network that can be enabled over specific periods of time. The ability of supporting **online resource discovery** allows programs to directly target these situations natively and be reactive to changes to the resources available to a system.

Other applications, such as those designed for safety critical enviroments, require the ability to recover from hardware failures. This requires that the resources available within a system can be queried and can be expected to change at any point during the execution of a program. For example GPU may encounter encounter exceptional behaviour or overheat and need to be disabled, yet the program must continue at all costs. **Fault tolerance** allows programs to query the availability of resources and handle failures, which could facilitate reliable programming of heterogeneous and distributed systems.

From a historic perspective, many different programming models have tackled the problem of **dynamic resource discovery** following various approaches. [MPI (Message Passing Interface)][mpi] originally (in MPI-1) did not support **dynamic resource discovery**. All processes which were capable of communicating with each other would be identified and fixed during at the **point of discovery**. [PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine)][pvm] enabled resources to be discovered at runtime since its conception, using an alternative execution model of manually spawning processes from the main process. This lead MPI to introduce the feature it in later MPI-2. However as far as we know, despite being available this feature is not widely used in HPC environments and the execution model of having all processes fixed on initialisation is generally still the prefered approach. Other programming models for HPC environments support a fixed set of processors on initialization library time, such as SHMEM, Fortran coarrays and UPC++.

Some of these programming models also address **fault tolerance**, in particular, PVM has native support for this, providing a [mechanism][pvm-callback] which can notify a program when a resource is added or removed from a system . MPI whilst it does not have native support for a PVM-like **fault tolerance** mechanism can be [implemented on top of MPI][mpi-post-failure-recovery] or provided via [extensions][mpi-fault-tolerance].

Due to the complexity involved in standardising **dynamic resource discovery** and **fault tolerance** these are outside currently out of the scope of this paper.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface support **dynamic resource discovery**? |

## Lifetime considerations

As the execution context would provide a partitioning interface which returns objects describing the components of the system topology of an execution resource it’s important to consider the lifetime of these objects.

The objects returned from the partitioning interface would be opaque implementation defined objects which do not perform any scheduling or execution functionality which would be expected from an **execution context** and would not store any state related to an execution. Instead they would act simply as an identifier to a particular partition of the **resource topology**.

For these reasons **resources** must always outlive any **execution context** which is constructed from them and any **resource** retrieved from an **execution context** must not be tied to the lifetime of that **execution context**.

### Scaling to heterogeneous and distributed systems

The initial solution should target systems with a single addressable memory region, thus, excluding devices like discrete GPUs. of maintaining a unified interface going forward, the initial solution should consider these devices and be able to scala to support them in the future. In particular to support heterogeneous systems it’s important that the abstraction allows the interface for querying the **resource topology** of the **system** in order to perform device discovery.

## Querying the Relative Affinity of Partitions

In order to make decisions about where to place execution or allocate memory in a given **system’s resource topology**, it is important to understand the concept of affinity between different **execution resources**. This is usually expressed in terms of latency from resource a to b. Distance does not need to be symmetric in all architectures.

The relative position of two components in the topology is not necessary and indicative of their affinity. For example, two cores from two different CPU sockets may have the same latency to access to the same NUMA memory node.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface allow users to query the relative affinity between two execution resources? |
| *Do we want to implement a complete interface for affinity querying on C++ or do we leave this for library vendors?* |
| *Do we need to define terms such as latency on the C++ standard?* |
| *What should such an interface look like and should it be quantifiable?* |
| *Do we consider enough to show the number of “hops” for data to move from one resource to the other?* |

### Scaling to heterogeneous and distributed systems

This feature could be easily scaled to heterogeneous and distributed systems as the relative affinity between components can apply to discrete heterogeneous and distributed systems as well.

## Binding Execution and Allocation to a Partition

When creating an **execution context** from a given **execution resource**, the executors and allocators associated with it are bound to that **execution resource**. For example: when creating an **execution resource** from a CPU socket resource, all executors associated with the given socket will spawn execution agents with affinity to the socket partition of the system.

```cpp
auto cList = std::execution::this_system::resources();
// FindASocketResource is a user-defined function that finds a 
// resource that is a CPU socket in the given resource list
auto& socket = findASocketResource(cList);
execution_contexteC{socket} // Associated with the socket
auto executor = eC.executor(myFunctor); // By transitivity, associated with the socket too
auto socketAllocator = eC.allocator(); // Retrieve an allocator to the closest memory node
std::vector<int, socketAllocator> v1(100);
std::generate(par.on(executor), std::begin(v1), std::end(v1), std::rand);
```
*Listing 8: Example of allocating with affinity to an execution resource*

The construction of an **execution context** on a component implies affinity (where possible) to the given resource. This guarantees that all executors created from that **execution context** can access the resources and the internal data structures requires to guarantee the placement of the processor.

Only developers that care about resource placement need to care about obtaining executors and allocations from the correct **execution context** object. Existing code for vectors and STL (including Parallel STL interface) remains unaffected.

If a particular policy or algorithm requires to access placement information, the resources associated with the passed executor can be retrieved via the link to the **execution context**.

# Future Work

## Migrating data from memory allocated in one partition to another

In some cases for performance it is important to bind a memory allocation to a memory region for the duration of an a tasks execution, however in other cases it’s important to be able to migrate the data from one memory region to another. This is outside the scope of this paper, however we would like to investigate this in a future paper.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface provide a way of migrating data between partitions? |

## Defining memory placement algorithms or policies

With the ability to place memory with affinity comes the ability to define algorithms or memory policies which describe at a higher level how memory is distributed across large systems. Some examples of these are pinned, first touch and scatter. This is outside the scope of this paper, however we would like to investigate this in a future paper.

| Straw Poll |
|------------|
| Should the interface provide standard algorithms or policies for distributing memory? |
